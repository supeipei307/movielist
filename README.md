# movielist
This small project shows how to use Hadoop mapreduece technology to handle the semi-structured data from IMDB ftp server.
The input is a movie list file that with a lot of free text, the output is a tab seperated file that can be read by Hive directly.
A lot of regular expressions are used to match the free text and get the useful information.
